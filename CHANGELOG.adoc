= Changelog

== 4.0
_March, 2019_

* All the references to the term “Environment” or “Logical environment”
have been replaced by the term “Target” to become properly consistent
with the new terminology of _RapidDeploy 5_.

* All the functionality that was duplicated on the Jenkins build steps and
post-build actions, especially the calls to the
https://github.com/MidVision/rapiddeploy-connector[_RapidDeploy_ connector],
was fully refactored into a single class.

* New functionality for the https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins
Pipeline] was included in the plugin in the form of 3 new pipeline
steps:

** *_rdPackageBuild_*: for _RapidDeploy_ deployment package creation.
** *_rdProjectDeploy_*: for _RapidDeploy_ project deployment.
** *_rdJobPlanRun_*: for _RapidDeploy_ job plan run.

== 3.10
_March, 2017_

* Added new feature that provides the ability to pass data dictionary
values to a _RapidDeploy_ deployment as Jenkins parameters in a parametrized build.
Data dictionary parameters need to be specify like data dictionary keys, i.e., `@@PARAMETER_NAME@@`.
In _RapidDeploy_ a new package will be created with the overridden parameter(s) injected.

** *This feature is available from _RapidDeploy 4.2.2_ onwards.*

be able to run job plans from _RapidDeploy_.

to deploy on _RapidDeploy_ there is the option to use a Jenkins parameter.
